# `pcgp`: parallel Cartesian Genetic Programming
`cgp-torch` is a small library implementing Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP)
parallelized over multiple independent populations, using PyTorch as a backend.
It is mainly targeted towards speeding up CGP research projects in which the
same configuration must be tested several times for statistical significance.
